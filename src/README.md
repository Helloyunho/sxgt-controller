# Sixtar Gate: STARTRAIL Controller Source

## FORK OF [GURUTHREE'S REPOSITORY](https://github.com/guruthree/pico-superkey-board)

The source of my controller. It's based on [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) but it should work on any RP2040 boards with TinyUSB support.
